# Reflection
# What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
#
# figuring out how to pass the address hash into the hash syntax.
# What parts felt most comfortable to you?
# it seemed pretty straight forward to me except for the hash within a hash
# What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
# EVERYTHING!!!!  MORE REPETITION.
