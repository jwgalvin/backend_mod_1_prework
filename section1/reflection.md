## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
*    The article resonated with me in that it is a philosophy that needs embracing. It is far to easy to find a comfortable spot in life and slip into neutral.  My journey through life is taking me away from a career that I've had for almost a decade and allowed myself to stagnant a little.  By changing my mindset and starting a journey of learning and doing I'll find push myself. I've always been a voracious reader, though historically I haven't been good at taking short breaks.  That'll be a skill I'll have to learn and enforce with myself.  What isn't on the list is being a team player and effective communicator. There is much to learn from other people.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    In a ruby file type the Line

  *  ```ruby
    p "Hello World!"
    ```
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  *  # the hash or pound sign comments out a line

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  *  An integer is a whole number.  A float is a number with a decimal. Floats are more precise.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  *
  ```ruby
    animal = "zebra"
    ```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
*
  ```ruby
    animal = "zebra"
    p animal
    ```
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  *  Interpolation is printing a string that uses a variable(s) to fill in the "blanks."
    ```ruby
    p "The #{animal} is secretly the most lethal of all the horselike animals."
    ```
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
  *  gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  *  interpolation - inserting a variable that can have different meanings into another string.
    Concatenation - Concatenation joins to different strings together.
