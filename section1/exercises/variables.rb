# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
var_1 = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p var_1

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students += 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students -= 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Joe"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 1
p "my first name is #{first_name}."
p "I is #{is_hungry} that I am currently hungry."
p " and that my sig other and I have #{number_of_pets} pet, that is a cat."
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# names are Strings
# whether or not I am hungry is a boolean. its true or false. Though in my case it is genreally always true.
# Num_o_pets is a numerical variable that is currently known but could change, so its value can be assigned.



# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Joseph"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 2
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
puts total_snacks



#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?

  #yes it did.
